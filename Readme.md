# Objective-C Playground

Objective-C Playground is pretty much what it sounds like. Its intended to be a collection of experiements to test ideas for new classes and extensions to the Objective-C language. I wouldn't really use anything here in production code. Nothing here is guaranteed to work at all. Proceed at your own risk.
